The segmentation fault is likely because we need to wait on and reset the fence for the secondCopyStage at the beginning of the frame. Let's check where we wait for fences:

In the render() function, we need to modify the fence waiting code at the beginning:

cpp

Copy
// Wait for all stages to complete from previous frame
std::array<VkFence, 4> stageFences = {  // Changed from 3 to 4 fences
    renderStage.fences[currentFrame],
    firstCopyStage.fences[currentFrame],
    secondCopyStage.fences[currentFrame],  // Added this line
    finalCopyStage.fences[currentFrame]
};

vkWaitForFences(device, stageFences.size(), stageFences.data(), VK_TRUE, UINT64_MAX);
vkResetFences(device, stageFences.size(), stageFences.data());
Also, make sure the fences for secondCopyStage are created in createSynchronizationPrimitives():

cpp

Copy
void createSynchronizationPrimitives()
{
    createStageSyncObjects(renderStage, "render");
    createStageSyncObjects(firstCopyStage, "firstCopy");
    createStageSyncObjects(secondCopyStage, "secondCopy");  // Make sure this is called
    createStageSyncObjects(finalCopyStage, "finalCopy");
    
    // Create present semaphores
    VkSemaphoreCreateInfo semaphoreCI{};
    semaphoreCI.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SEMAPHORE_CREATE_INFO;
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < MAX_CONCURRENT_FRAMES; i++) {
        VK_CHECK_RESULT(vkCreateSemaphore(device, &semaphoreCI, nullptr, &presentCompleteSemaphores[i]));
    }
}
This should resolve the segmentation fault by properly initializing and waiting on all stage fences.

For Android, we need to be extra careful about queue access. Let me check if the queue handle is actually valid when we're using it:

First, let's verify where queue is coming from. In the original code, queue should be initialized in the base class, but let's explicitly check it:
cpp

Copy
// Add before queue submit
if (queue == VK_NULL_HANDLE) {
    // Get queue if not already initialized
    vkGetDeviceQueue(device, swapChain.queueNodeIndex, 0, &queue);
}

// Now do the submit
VK_CHECK_RESULT(vkQueueSubmit(queue, 1, &submitInfo, secondCopyStage.fences[currentFrame]));
Or more thoroughly, we could add a queue handle specifically for our copy operations:

cpp

Copy
// Add to class members
VkQueue copyQueue{ VK_NULL_HANDLE };

// In prepare() or init
void prepare() {
    // Get queue for copy operations
    vkGetDeviceQueue(device, swapChain.queueNodeIndex, 0, &copyQueue);
    // ... rest of prepare
}

// Then in the copy stage:
VK_CHECK_RESULT(vkQueueSubmit(copyQueue, 1, &submitInfo, secondCopyStage.fences[currentFrame]));
The segmentation fault on Android but not Windows suggests we might have a platform-specific queue handling issue. The above changes should help catch and fix that.

Would you like me to show the complete modified context around this fix?
